In the version ' cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.13.0-0-virtualbox' easy_install does not work.
In order to install IPython, I first had to install pip: $sudo yum install python-pip
And after that I could install python: $sudo pip install ipython==1.2.1

PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython pyspark
sc.version
#Result: u'1.6.0'
